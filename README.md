    Question is : > Given an integer array arr and a filtering function fn, return a filtered array filteredArr.
    The fn function takes one or two arguments:
    arr[i] - number from the arr
    i - index of arr[i]
    filteredArr should only contain the elements from the arr for which the expression fn(arr[i], i) evaluates to a truthy value. A truthy value is a value where Boolean(value) returns true.

    Please solve it without the built-in Array.filter method.
